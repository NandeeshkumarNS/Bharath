                            The major challenges that the educational institutions face these days are the difficulty in promoting a course from their program and reaching out to a larger niche audience for pre-admissions. Promoting the courses to eligible students and parents at the right time is possible when institutions have the access to the mailing list of schools, colleges, and universities.
